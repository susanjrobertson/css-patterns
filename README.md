css-patterns
============

This is just a place for me to store and add to more of the patterns I have come to rely on when writing CSS. They come from a variety of sources and I am thankful to all the devs I've worked with who've helped along the way.

These patterns are meant to be used in an OOCSS or SMACSS way of writing the code. Reusable and modular so that the CSS doesn't get out of control huge in large sites and you can write your HTML based on the document outline and accessibility rather than styles.

Hopefully this will change and grow over time. Eventually I'm hoping to make this a bit more Sass friendly, but since I currently don't do most of my work in Sass, I just haven't done it.
